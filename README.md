## Hey, I'm Mukund.

> I like training machine learning models to solve various problems and sometimes building applications around them.

I'm a rising senior studying Networked and Social Systems Engineering (B.S.E.) and Data Science (M.S.E.) at Penn.

Currently, I'm building [Catacomb](github.com/catacomb-ai/catacomb), a library of tools to better understand the quality of machine learning models.

I'm also working on a few projects with Penn NLP including [Turkish Judge](github.com/mukund-v/turkish-judge) and machine translation models to translate Python code to it's English intent.

See my [website](mukund-v.github.io) for more about me.
