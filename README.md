## Hey, I'm [Mukund](https://mukund-v.github.io).

> I like training machine learning models to solve various problems and sometimes building applications around them.

I'm a rising senior studying Networked and Social Systems Engineering (B.S.E.) and Data Science (M.S.E.) at Penn.

ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- [Catacomb](https://github.com/catacomb-ai/catacomb), a scalable infrastructure for deployment of machine learning prototypes, allowing you to demo, share, and play with models without dealing with containerization or web development.
- Training machine translation models to convert Python code into it's English intent.

ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- How to train translation models in [Fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq)
- How to build [React](https://reactjs.org/) apps
