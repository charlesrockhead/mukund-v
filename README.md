## Hey, I'm Mukund.

> I like training machine learning models to solve various problems and sometimes building applications around them.

I'm a rising senior studying Networked and Social Systems Engineering (B.S.E.) and Data Science (M.S.E.) at Penn.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

- [Catacomb](https://github.com/catacomb-ai/catacomb), a library of tools to better understand the quality of machine learning models.
- [Turkish Judge](https://github.com/mukund-v/turkish-judge), a platform for crowd-based adjudication of rejected tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
- Training machine learning models to translate Python code to it's English intent.
